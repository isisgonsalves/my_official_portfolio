PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
-
This website previews myself as an individual. 
It includes my bio, my qualifications, my projects and a means to contact me.

What was my motivation?
-
I was motivated to do this project purely because I was craving to learn a new skill. 
HTML and CSS is useful and it would be a great skill to master. 

Why did I build this project?
-
I built this project specifically because I figured it would be a good start in this HTML journey.
Additionally, I figured it would be interesting to include when sending my CV to professionals.

What problem does it solve?
-
It didnt solve a specfic problem but it definitely increased my hireability.

What did I learn?
-
This is honestly my first time really writing HTML or CSS, so I learnt ALOT. 

What makes my project stand out?
-
My project specifically stands out because I wanted it to be a creative space to broadcast me and my personality as an individual rather than simply a student.

What can I improve?
-
Alot of things actually. As mentioned before, this is truly my first project. The most crucial thing that I need to implement is a mobile view. 
I am terrified to see how my website currently translates.
